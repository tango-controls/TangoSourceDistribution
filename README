1 - INTRODUCTION
----------------
This is the README for the TANGO source code release. TANGO is a
toolkit for building object oriented control systems based on CORBA. 
TANGO is a joint effort of the ESRF, ELETTRA, ALBA, DESY and SOLEIL synchrotron 
radiation sources.

This source code release is based on the latest version of TANGO 8 (8.0.0)
and is intended for Unix platforms. A binary version for Windows of TANGO 
is available. The source code contained in this package 
runs on Windows but the Makefile don't.

Tango 8 and above is compliant to the 64 bit architecture.

This package is foreseen (and was tested) to run with omniORB4.1.6 and
Java 1.6

The default Pogo application in this package can generate source code
for C++. The old Pogo application is also provided to
generate Java and Python device servers.

The database server delivered with this package do not force the MySQL
user to be root. You have to use the my.cnf configuration files
or the MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD environment variables to specify
the MySQL account to be used by the database server.

The TangoTest device server delivered with this package is an example 
implementation of all possible Tango data types. 
The displayed data is animated what creates some CPU load 
when running the server. Starting an atkpanel (generic Tango client)
on a device of this server is CPU and memory consuming, because
all possible data is read and displayed.

In the case of upgrading an alreay running Tango system, please follow
the instructions in the chapter UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS TANGO RELEASES.


2 - WHAT'S INSIDE
-----------------

starter device server, it allows full remote Tango control system administration.
Its documentation is at :

	http://www.esrf.eu/computing/cs/tango/tango_doc/tools_doc/astor_doc/index.html
	
The Pogo application is a graphical Tango device server code generator.
Its documentation is at :

	http://www.esrf.eu/computing/cs/tango/tango_doc/tools_doc/pogo_doc/index.html
	
tg_devtest is a device testing application for device server which do not
use the database. It is a sub-part of Jive. 

3 - PREREQUISITES
-----------------

Before compiling and installing TANGO you need to install :

(1) omniORB available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/omniorb 
    (version >= 4.1 but not 4.1.1. Preferably version 4.1.6).
	 OmniORB is mandatory to build the Tango libraries and the delivered Tango 
	 device servers.

(2) zmq available from http://www.zeromq.org (version >= 3.1).
	 Zmq is mandatory to build the Tango libraries and the delivered Tango 
	 device servers.

(3) mysql available from http://mysql.org (version >= 5.0).
	 Mysql is mandatory to install a Tango database. To compile the delivered 
	 database server, only the mysql client library libmysqlclient_r is
	 needed.
	     
(4) doxygen available from http://www.doxygen.org

    Remark : doxygen is not mandatory to run Tango. It is just used by our code
             generator (called Pogo) to automatically generates some part of 
	     the Tango device server documentation. If you don't install it,
	     this part of the documenetaion will simply not be generated.
	     But in all cases, some HTML pages documenting Tango device server
	     will allways be generated.

Also check the tools you are using

(1) If you are using gcc, you need to have gcc release 3.2.0 or above. You can
    download gcc from http://gcc/gnu.org

(2) Only java release 1.6.0 or above is supported, you can download java from
    http://java.sun.com/j2se (See chapter 4, Java sub-chapter).
	 Java is mandatory to install and run the Tango tools.


4 - INSTALLING
--------------

Once you have installed the packages in prerequisites you can think
about configuring and compiling TANGO. 

To configure TANGO you need to tell it where to find omniORB and
mysql (if it is in a non-standard place) and where to install
TANGO.

The main options for configure are:
--prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                        [/usr/local]
--enable-static[=PKGS]
                        build static libraries [default=no]
--disable-java          disable installation of Java applications
--disable-dbserver      disable installation of Tango database server.
--disable-dbcreate      enable an creation of the Tango database schema
--disable-jpegmmx		disable jpeg mmx optimization
  
--with-java             path to java interpreter
--with-doxygen          path to doxygen utility  
--with-zlib=DIR         root directory path of zlib installation defaults to
                        /usr/local or /usr if not found in /usr/local
--with-omni             prefix to omniORB installation (default: $OMNI_ROOT)
--with-zmq				prefix to ZMQLIB installation

--with-tango-db-name	Name of the database created in mysql (default: tango)
--with-tango-rc-file	Location/name of the tango rc file (default: /etc/tangorc)

--with-mysqlclient-prefix=PFX
                        Prefix where mysqlclient is installed
--with-mysqlclient-include=DIR
                        Directory pointing to mysqlclient include files
--with-mysqlclient-lib=LIB
                        Directory pointing to mysqlclient library (Note:
                        -include and -lib do override paths found with
                        -prefix)

--with-mysql-ho         the host of the mysql database (default: <blank>)
--with-mysql-admin      super user of your mysql database (default: <blank>)
--with-mysql-admin-passwd
                        super user password of your mysql database (default:
                        <blank>)
								
The last three options can be replaced with a .my.cnf file in your home 
directory with the following content:

			[client]
			user      = [mysql login name]
            password  = [password]
			host      = [host name]

At the end of the configure script, a status is displayed indicating pathes
and versions of found software and the parts of the Tango package which are
ready to be installed.
Example:								
        
		Source code location:   ../..
        Version:                8.0.0
        Compiler:               gcc,g++

        OMNIORB PATH:           /segfs/tango/ORB/omniORB4.1.4/ubuntu1010
        OMNIORB VERSION:        "4.1.6"

        ZMQ PATH:               /segfs/tango/transport/zmq/ubuntu1010
        ZMQ VERSION:            3.1.0

        JAVA PATH:              /usr/bin/java

        MYSQL VERSION:          5.1.49
        MYSQL CONNECTION:       OK

build:
        libraries:              yes
        java application:       yes
		access control server:	yes
        database server:        yes
        database schema create: yes


Hints to configure:

The Tango database server
-------------------------
To compile and install the Tango database server, the threadsafe version of
the mysql client library libmysqlclient_r must be available.
Use the --with-mysqlclient* options when the library is not found. To disable 
the compilation and installation of the database server, 
use --disable-dbserver. 

Create the Tango database
-------------------------
To allow the configure script to create the Tango database in
your MySQL database, make sure that the mysql version is >5.0 and
the mysqld is running before doing configure.
Also check that the mysql client (called mysql) is in your path.

If you are not running the configure script on the same host
where the mysql server is running, use the "--with-mysql-ho" configure
option or the host entry in the my.cnf file. 

The configure script will try to connect to the
MySql database. Make sure that privileges are granted to
the user used by configure running on the host where you
run configure. 

The configure options "--with-mysql-admin" and "--with-mysql-admin-passwd"
allow you to select which MySql user configure will use.
You can also use the user and password entries of the my.cnf file
to set-up your connection to mysql.

To disable any access to mysql use the --disable-dbcreate option.

Database server, mysql and libz
-------------------------------
Depending on how MySql has been installed, the Tango database
server may need the compress/uncompress library (called "libz").
By default, configure try to find this compress/uncompress stuff.
If you don't need it, use the configure "--without-zlib".								  

Java applications
-----------------
Tango arrives with many Java applications. Each java applications has
its own script (in $prefix/bin) where the CLASSPATH is set before 
starting the java interpreter. These scripts will be modified by the
configure script to set a correct path to the java interpreter found in
your PATH when configure was run. You can also use the "--with-java=xxx"
to define a path to the java interpreter.

It is not mandatory to find the java interpreter in your PATH. You can use 
the "--disable-java" configure option to build Tango. 
When java was not found, disabled, or found with un unsufficient version, 
the installation of the java applications is disabled.

doxygen
-------
Doxygen is a documentation generator from C++ source files. It is used by the
Tango code generator (called Pogo) to generate Tango device server documentation.
The script used to start Pogo will be modified bt the configure script to set
a correct path to the doxygen command found in your PATH when configure was
run. You can also used the "--with-doxygen=xxx" to define a path to the
doxygen command.
It is not mandatory to find the doxygen command in your PATH or to use the
"--with-doxygen" configure option to build and run Tango. This will only prevent
some part of Tango device server documentation to be generated by Pogo.


You can type "configure --help" to get a print of all the options
supported by the configure script.

Here is an example of running configure for TANGO telling it where
to install (--prefix) TANGO and where omniORB and ZMQ are installed:

cd $directory_where_tango_has_been_installed
mkdir build
cd build
export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++
../configure --prefix=/home/tango/release/install_dir_linux \
	--with-omni=/segfs/tango/ORB/omniORB4.1.6/ubuntu1010 \
    --with-zmq=/segfs/tango/transport/zmq/ubuntu1010

	
During the configure procedure the access to mysql is tested. Please prepare
your my.cnf (mysql configuration file) or use the configure options
               --with-mysql-admin
               --with-mysql-admin-passwd
               --with-mysql-ho
to specify the access to the mysql database.
	

5 - COMPILING
-------------

Once configure has run successfully you can compile and install the
executables, include files, libraries and scripts. Do this by typing :

make all

make install


6 - RUNNING
-----------

To test wether the TANGO build worked do the following :

(1) start the database on port 10000 by typing :

    TANGO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/DataBaseds 2 -ORBendPoint giop:tcp::10000
    
	 Specify the mysql account to be used by the database server.
	 Two possibilities are available:
	 	- set the following environment variables to the account and 
		  password to be used
    
			MYSQL_USER to specify the mysql login name
			MYSQL_PASSWORD to specify the password
			MYSQL_HOST if required
			  
		- configure the mysql client with the mysql configuration 
		  file my.cnf
		  		
			[client]
			user      = [mysql login name]
            password  = [password]

(2) Configure the TANGO_HOST environment variable with the hostname the
    database server is running on and the port number used.

    setenv TANGO_HOST hostname:10000

(3) start the test device server tangoTest :

    TANGO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/TangoTest test

(4) start jive by typing for example :

    TANGO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/jive
    
    (See chapter 4 java sub-chapter to check the jive script) 

(5) test your device using the test device in jive

(6) write new device servers using pogo :

    TANGO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/pogo

    (See chapter 4 java sub-chapter to check the pogo script) 


7 - UPDATING FROM PREVIOUS TANGO RELEASES
-----------------------------------------

WARNINGS:

To update the Tango database, the distribution provides some scripts.
The "make install" command will create these database related scripts in
<install_dir>/share/tango/db ONLY if the mysql database connection test
done at configure time is successfull ("database schema create" reported
as yes at the end of the configure script execution)


7-1 - UPDATING FROM A TANGO 7.2 DATABASE
--------------------------------------

Tango 8.0 is provided with a small update of the data in the database. This is simply a new
release of the stored procedure and two new commands in the list of allowed commands for the
Database class (for Tango Access Control system).

To update your database, follow these instructions:

a - Stop your control system and your database server(s)

b - Backup your database (Recommended, not mandatory)

c - Cd to the <install_dir>/share/tango/db directory

d - Run the update script:
	./update_db.sh
	
e - Restart your database server(s)


7-2 - UPDATING FROM A TANGO 6 DATABASE
--------------------------------------

Tango 8 needs an update of the data in the database. This is simply some new
commands definition for the Tango control access and a new stored procedure release.

To update your database, follow these instructions:

a - Stop your control system and your database server(s)

b - Backup your database (Recommended, not mandatory)

c - Cd to the <install_dir>/share/tango/db directory

d - Run the update script:
	mysql -u[user] -p[password] < ./update_db6.sql
	
e - Restart your database server(s)


8 - DOCUMENTATION
-----------------

Don't forget to READ THE MANUAL (in doc/tango.pdf) !

9 - REMARKS
-----------

TANGO 8.0:
Tango 8.0 is a major release. Recompiling a device server with Tango 8.0 
means recompiling ALL classes of the device server. You need to work with
coherent include files.

TANGO 7.0:
Tango 7.0 is a major release. Recompiling a device server with Tango 7.0 
means recompiling ALL classes of the device server. You need to work with
coherent include files.

TANGO 6.1:
The database server in this package uses stored procedures. To make it reliably 
work the MySQL version must be >5.0.
To exploit the full performance of the new database server, on an already 
installed Tango system, the the chapter UPDATING FROM PREVIOUS TANGO RELEASES.

TANGO 6.0:
Tango 6.0 is a major release, because it uses omniORB 4.1 which is
a major release of omniORB. The code generated from the with the IDL
compiler is not compatible with the code gernerated with omniORB 4.0.x!
To avoid any confusion with new and old libraries we decided to
make also a major Tango release.

Recompiling a device server with Tango 6.0 and omniORB 4.1 means 
recompiling ALL classes of the device server. You need to work with
coherent include files.
