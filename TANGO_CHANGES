Tango 8 has been developped and tested using:

- omniORB 4.1.6
- zmq 3.1
- log4tango 4.0.5

Changes between Log4tango 4.0.3 and Log4Tango 4.0.5
---------------------------------------------------

- SourceForge bug 3156197
- Fix warnings when Tango is compiled -Wall -Wextra
- Add Windows port for Windows 64 bits VC10

Changes in Tango itself
-----------------------

- New event system based on ZMQ
- New methods to manage polling in DeviceImpl class (is_attribute_polled()/is_command_polled,
get_attribute_poll_period()/get_command_poll_period(), poll_attribute()/poll_command(),
stop_poll_attribute()/stop_poll_command())
- DevEncoded data type supported for commands
- New Attribute class setter/getter methods for min_alarm, max_alarm, min_warning and max_warning attribute properties
- Cleaner way to reset kernel attribute properties to lib/user default value
- Add some C++11 features when compiler support them (Lambda functions - unique_ptr for extension classes -
Move contructor and assignement for DeviceData and DeviceAttribute classes)
This requires a new compilation option (-std=c++0x)
- The DeviceProxy and DeviceAttribute classes copy constructor and assignement operator now really copy the data
- Add device log messages when any device attribute(s) quality factor changes
(ATTR_INVALID -> error stream, ATTR_CHANGING -> info stream, ATTR_VALID -> info stream
ATTR_ALARM: min/max alarm -> error stream, min/max warning + rds -> warning stream)
- Add a clean_db parameter to the DeviceImpl::remove_attribute() method. Default is true
- New DeviceProxy::get_access_right() method
- New Util::is_svr_starting(), Util::is_svr_shutting_down() and Util::is_device_restarting() methods
- New DeviceClass::get_cmd_by_name() method
- New DServer::_create_cpp_class() method (For PyTango)
- Remove warnings compilation (Tango is now compiled with -Wall and -Wextra)
- Add Group::command_inout(), Group::command_inout_asynch(), Group::write_attribute() and Group::write_attribute_asynch()
with vector<DeviceData> to carry the data.
- Improvements in event management for notifd events (link to bug 3293671)
- For writable and memorized attribute(s), check coherency of new min/max_value with memorized value when the
attribute configuration is modified.
- State computation for device with alarmed attributes: If the attribute is polled, the attribute value is
read from the polling buffer (also true when reading the state as a CORBA attribute)
- Add pre-processor define for Tango release number management (TANGO_VERSION_MAJOR, TANGO_VERSION_MINOR
and TANGO_VERSION_PATCH)
- Host IP address(es) is(are) now retrieved from network interface(s)
- Add a check during set_attribute_config() call for users trying to change hard coded properties
- Optimization in DeviceProxy methods to get asynchronous call replies when caller uses a timeout in case the
reply is already there
- Remove some "cerr" messages in AttributeProxy class
- Uil::get_host_name() always returns host name in lower case letters
- The caller PID is now reported in black-box also when UNIX socket is used as transport
- write_attribute() called during device server startup sequence due to memorized attribute(s) is reported 
in black box with a specific message
- It's now possible to poll command/attribute in a device server started without database for command/attributes
with polling defined in code
- Add a polling thread tuning after the execution of UpdObjPollingPeriod command
- Remove all Solaris specific code
- Remove all old stream specific code
- Signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 can now be used within a device server process
- Optimize database calls during device server startup and shutdown sequence (When TAC is used or when
dynamic attributes are used)
- Added Database class copy constructor and assignment operator
- Tango is now compiled with Debian hardenning flags on.

Note: Tango 7.2.2 to 7.2.5 have never been officially released outside ESRF.

- Replace the deprecated gethosybyname() and gethostbyaddr()calls. This allows running Tango on
  OS like Ubuntu 10.10 with the default /etc/hosts file
- Optimize database call retries number during device server startup sequence.
- Added a DeviceProxy::get_access_right() method
- Add a check on empty device name in DeviceProxy ctor methods
- Add a encoded_format.h file for DevEncoded string definition
- Reset SIGINT and SIGQUIT to their default behavior during DS startup sequence.
This is needed in case of Tango class using signals and started as background process by a shell
script

Tango 7.2.0 has been developed and tested with omniORB 4.1.4

Remarks about omniORB 4.1.4
---------------------------

- SourceForge bug number 3054292 (client hangs on ping) is solved by a omniORB patch available in the SourceForge bug tracker
- SourceForge bug number 3011742 (memory leak) is also solved by 2 omniORB patches available in the SourceForge bug tracker


New / Optimized features
------------------------

- The client API is now thread-safe:
This means that you can share a pointer to a DeviceProxy class instance between several thread. Note that if one thread changes
data like the device time-out, this change will be seen by all the other threads using this device.
In next major release (Tango 8), a new mechanism will be implemented allowing the user to choose if he want a thread safe 
or unsafe device proxy. For compatibility reason, it was not possible to include this change in a non major release.
- It's now possible for applications to subscribe several times to the same event (with or without the same callback object)
- Add check on attribute dimension when using AttrData<T> class to fill polling buffer hsitory
- Subscribe to a data ready event fails if the Attr::set_data_ready_event() method has not been called (in the server side).
This allows application to be aware that the device could/couldn't fire data ready event
- Added insertion operators (<<) in the DeviceAttribute class for const char * and Tango::DevString
- Polling and logging related commands allowed only for the device lock owner when the device is locked
- Add a way to externally fill-up the polling buffer for R/W attribute when specifying the attribute written part
- No more database call executed by DeviceProxy constructor if it is called in a device server and the device is in the same process
- Better management of device server started on host with several network interface (ORBendPoint option not needed any more)
- Added a ApiUtil::get_env_var() method (static)
- Better timeout management during re-connection in case of device server running on a host switched off
- Add a new way to write class_factory() as a function instead of a DServer class method. Needed for PyTango on Windows using DLL
- NaN is now taken into account in RDS alarm for float/double (and array of) attributes


SourceForge features request
----------------------------

- 2721963 : Implemented a much faster device server shutdown sequence
- 3004584 : Add a way to define a minimum polling period using properties

- DeviceImpl::remove_attribute() does not correctly manage main attribute vecor indexes preventing nice implementation of
  dynamic attributes
- The value set by a WAttribute::set_write_value() if used in the attribute write method (write_MyAttribute) was overwritten

- Stateless event subscription : an event subscription is possible now, 
  even when the device server is not running. The subscribe_event method 
  takes a new boolean parameter to trigger stateless event subscription.
  
- Attribute::set_write_value methods have been added for spectrum and image
  data types.
  
- Added extratction methods to DeviceAttribute to individually extract
  read and set point values. Added methods to read the data dimensions 
  which are compatible with the Java API.
  
- Ported to MacOSX

- Class dlls for Windows can be created and can be used as for UNIX now.

- Device server now uses a database cache to get all their data during 
  their starting sequence. This cache is filled in by a new Database server
  command and destroyed at the end of the startup sequence. When possible, all
  data are fetched from this cache instead of from the database.
  If it is not possible to fill in this cache for any reason, the device server
  process starts using the traditional way.

- Optimize network calls during connection establishment between client and server

- Implement a new timeout management for database object access. The timeout
  used has a different value when the device server is in its starting phase

- Automatic management of a TCP connection establishment timeout for the
  database object

- Add new Database class methods to interface the two new database server
  commands (DbGetDataForServerCache and DbDeleteAllDeviceAttributeProperty)

- Change the way the DB is cleanup up due to dynamic attribute deletion
  during device server shutdown

- Default value for the "doc_url" part of the info() network call changed
  to "http://www.tango-controls.org"

- Add new methods allowing a better way to set the CVS tag and CVS location
  info returned by the info() network call

- Add 2 new Attribute::set_properties() methods which can be used in a Tango class
  init_device() method


- Bug fixes:  
	- Solved deadlock when subscribing events from different threads.
	- Initialisation of memorized attributes during the init command.
	- Correction of client and server shutdown procedures when using 
	  the event client part.
	- Corrected the event synchronisation when a client is using another
	  threading package than omnithreads.
	- Fix client multi-threading issue when a CORBA exception was received during
	  a re-connection
	- Name letters case bug in polling thread command and in polled objects
      name stored in database
	- One re-connection case was not "transparent"
	- Clarify some exception messages
	- Polling thread synchronisation bug for internal commands start-polling, stop-polling
	  and rem-obj-polling
	- Bug in the admin device RemObjPolling command related to polling
	  properties management (When the removed object was last polled object)
	- Bug in asynchronous call in PUSH_CALLBACK mode when used intensively
	- Polling configuration mismatch after an Init command on the admin device
	- The DbGetDeviceList database command now has the same wildcard for its two 
	  parameters ("*")
	- Bug in the remote "info" call for devices implementing IDL3
	  (missing CVS Tag and CVS location)
	- Bug when getting the State history using the command_history() calls

               *  Tango release 6.0 : Changes since version 5.5.2  *
               *                                                   *
               *****************************************************

- Ported to OmniORB 4.1, which is a major release of omniORB and
  changes the generated code from the IDL.
  
- Ported to 64 bit architectures (Linux and Windows (x64))


- Add an attribute configuration event which is pushed every time an 
  attribute property changes. This allows to synchronize all client 
  displays of an attribute.
  
- Added new filterable fields "quality" and "delta-t" (sine last archive_event) 
  to the archive event
  
- Events with quality invalid are only send once as long as the quality
  stays invalid.
  
- Events with exceptions are only send once as long as the exception does
  not change.
  
- Modified the synchronisation between the event consumer and the keep 
  alive thread.
  Exchanged the global mutexes on the channel and the callback maps 
  by individual monitors for every channel and every callback. 
  The monitor can time-out and will not block the event reception 
  for a long time in case of problems.
  To synchronise with subscribe or unsubscribe requests, added a 
  global reader writer lock around the two maps.
  The subscribe thread is the writer and the event consumer and the keep 
  alive thread are the readers.

- When removing dynamic attributes all their configuration will be deleted
  now from the database. Polling configuration and event configuration
  properties will be deleted.
  
- Events are available for devices servers running with a file database
  or without database. 
  
- Filling polling buffer using Util::fill_attr_polling_buffer() now 
  possible also for R/W attribute
  
- Add get/set min/max_value methods family in the WAttribute class  
 

- A bunch of new methods was added to the C++ database API to implement
  the same functionality as the Java database API.
  get_host_list, get_services, register_service, unregister_service,
  get_class_for_device, get_class_inheritance_for_device,
  get_device_exported_for_class, put_device_alias, delete_device_alias,
  put_server_info, delete_server_info, get_server_class_list,
  get_server_name_list, get_instance_name_list, get_server_list,
  get_host_server_list, get_device_class_list, get_device_property_history,
  get_device_property_list, get_device_attribute_property_history,
  get_class_property_history, get_class_list, get_class_property_list,
  get_class_attribute_property_history, get_class_attribute_list,
  get_attribute_alias, put_attribute_alias, ...
 
  
- Methods to change timeouts for groups (common or individual)  

- New Util::get_tango_lib_release() method

- Add the DeviceClass::device_destoyer() method (opposite of the 
  device_factory)
  
- The polling thread is now configured without creating a separate thread 
  (new argument in its ADD_OBJ_POLLING command)

- Add omni_thread::ensure_self object in AutoTangoMonitor and 
  NoSyncModelTangoMonitor classes in order to use these objects in 
  threads not created by omni_thread (Python thread for instance)
  
- Add device name in Tango monitor print messages

- MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE is now 256 Mbytes
 
- Removed all #ifdef for HP-aCC compiler

- The Tango database server do not use the root account for MySQL any
  more. You can configure any account to be used via the my.cnf 
  configuration files or via the environment variables MYSQL_USER and
  MYSQL_PASSWORD.



- Bug fixes:
	- Polling did not restart correctly after an Init command on a device
	  server admin device

	- Bug in re-connection after a device server admin device Init, Restart or 
	  Devrestart command  

	- Two small memory leaks when dealing with dynamic attributes

	- Admin device did not handle device alias in its DevPollStatus command

	- Bug in add_attribute() method if you try to add an attribute with the 
	  same name but a different definition (different data type, data 
	  format, ...)
	  
	- Several bugs when removing dynamic attributes

	- Bug when removing a CORBA servant for non-exported device

	- Bug in Util::get_device_list_by_class() in some specific cases

	- Bug in the forced event without criteria checking. Some flag init. 
	  was missing

	- Bug in re-connection in case of asynchronous call

	- Bug in the subsribe_event() method when the DeviceProxy has been 
	  created using a syntax like "host:port/a/b/c" with host and port not 
	  the same than the one defined by the TANGO_HOST environment variable

	- In the case of a too long delivery time for events the notifd closes
	  the connection to a client. Now this case is detected in the client 
	  and the client will reconnect.

- Contains a new version of the Tango database which keeps a history
  of the last changes for every property. This needs the creation of
  new tables in MySQL and a new database server.
  
- Corrected the reconnection to the notification daemon in the case of
  network cuts.
- Increased the maximum data size to be transferred between server and 
  client from 8Mbytes to 16Mbytes.
- Since release 5.5 a server under windows could no longer be installed 
  as a windows service. Corrected the problem.

               *****************************************************

- Change and archive Events can be pushed manually from the code now 
  without polling. Two ways are possible:
  1.) Push events but check the event configuration 
     (as the polling thread). Events are fired exactly under the
	  same conditions as with the polling.
  2.) Push events without configuration check. 
      The event is fired without any value checking.
- The quality event was removed and integrated as filter "quality"
  to the change event.
  
- The user event was adapted to follow the structure of pushing 
  change or archive events.
  
- Event reconnection will follow now when a server was moved to a
  different host. The connection will be rebuild to the new notifd.
  
- Polling configuration for attributes and commands specified in 
  the code with Pogo are written to the database at server start-up.
  The polling will start immediately and no longer on a first reading
  request.
  
- The transparent reconnection is now the default reconnection mode.

- Naming requests to the database are cached for a DeviceProxy.
  A reconnection request will be emitted only once a second for a
  DeviceProxy connection.
  The same feature is implemented in the Java api.
  
- Debugging is now possible with the Linux 2.6 kernel.
- Support of gcc 4.0
- Support of VC7 and VC8 under Windos.
- Integration of code for device servers written in Python.

- Bug fixes:
	- Corrected event priod handling for periodic events.
	- Corrected rounding errors when checking the conditions.
	  of change and archive events.
	- Corrected constructor for the class GroupReply.

               *                                                   *
               *****************************************************

- Stopped the automatic polling startup of attributes at event subscription.
  All polling has be be configured manually!
  Subscription to events is only possible if the event properties
  for an attribute are properly configured and the polling is started!

- An exception during initialisation of memorized attributes
  will no longer result in an exit of the server.

- Memorized attributes can be used in two ways now.
  1) The setpoint gets initialised during a server startup.
     No write happens on the attribute.
  2.) The setpoint gets initialised during a server startup
      and is written to the attribute.
      The initialisation mode can be triggered by
      Attr::set_memorized_init(bool write_on_init) method
      during attribute creation.
      The two options are supported by Pogo.

 - The archive event behavior has changed. The archive period
   is no longer set to 10 seconds as default. If no period is
   specified, no periodic archive event is send.

- Bug fixes:
   - Corrected the wrong archive period reading after a
     server restart.

   - Changed DServerClass::instance() to return an exception
     in the case of a not initialised object.
     The exit() killed the server during a startup when
     a client sends requests to early.

   - Changed the clean-up mechanism when shutting down
     the ORB. Destroy ORB when returning from run().
     In 5.3 This was done in the main and when missing
     caused some threads to hang-up with the Linux kernel
     2.4.x.

   - Avoid calling Device_3Impl::status2attr() during
     attribute reading when an error was detected.
     Avoids segmentation fault in status2attr().

Main changes :
--------------

   - A new way to code attribute inside a device server.

   - It is now possible to read several attributes with the read_attributes
     call even if one of them failed.
     
   - It is now possible to write several attributes with the write_attributes
     call even if one of them failed.
     
   - Four new attribute data type which are : Boolean, float, unsigned char and
     unsigned short.
     
   - It now supports image and spectrum attributes as READ_WRITE or
      READ_WITH_WRITE attribute.
      
   - Device state and status can be read as attributes.
      
   - Added memorized attributes (only for scalar attribute).
   
   - Each attributes now support a four thresholds level alarm (instead of two)
   
   - Each attribute implements a Read Different than Set (RDS) alarms.
   
   - New attribute configuration set (including alarm and event parameters).

   - External triggering of the polling thread.
   
   - Add methods to set the attribute or command polling buffer.
   
   - A new device server command line option (-file=<file name>) allowing
     a device server to run using a file to get/store properties instead of the
     database.
     
   - Four monitors per device in a server instead of one allowing a better 
     concurrency model.
     
   - Auto tuning of the polling thread and configuration at device server
     startup time by a separate thread
   
Small changes :
---------------

   - It now uses omniORB 4.0.5
   
   - Exception thrown if you subscribed two (or more) times to the same event.
   
   - AttributeProxy class constructor suppports attribute name syntax like
     "device alias/attribute name".
     
   - Added calls in Database and DeviceProxy classes to get alias name from
     device name.
     
   - It is now possible to defined command or attribute polling buffer depth
     individually.
     
   - Added copy constructor, assignement operator and destructor for the
     EventData class.
     
   - DeviceProxy and AttributeProxy classes constructor allow device or
     attribute name specified like "//host:port/....".
     
   - Added the "source" parameter value in device black box for command_inout
     and read_attribute calls.
     
   - Only one line stored in device black box for command_inout or
     read_attribute calls when used from IDL release 2 or 3.
     
   - When killing a device server, it now waits for last request to be ended.
   
   - Added insertor/extractor for Boolean type to the DbDatum class.
   
   - The admin device command "QueryDevice" now returns device name in the
     following syntax : <class name>::<device name>.
     
   - Add some methods in the DeviceDataHistory and DeviceAttributeHistory
     classes for compatibility reasons.
     
   - Added many new Attribute::set_date and Attribute::set_value_date_quality
     methods.
     
   - The dev_type of the info call in now a string instead of a numer.
   
   - Added DeviceClass methods to set/get the info device type field.
   
   - If a server is not able to connect to the notifd on its host, it now
     unexports its event channel from the database.
     
   - The event heartbeat is now manage in the polling thread as a separate
     object. This allows to have periodic event of any period even greater
     than 10 seconds.
     
   - DeviceProxy::subsribe_event now throws exception in case of change event
     without any related attribute configuration parameters set.
     
   - New construcor in TangoMonitor class with a name to ease debugging.

     datbase device server release 2.4.0 or above. Compatibility with
     older database release is supported.
     
   - Remove all direct access to database device in a server. Now, always
     uses method of the Database class.
     
   - Change library default value for attribute label and format configuration
     set.
     
   - By default, DeviceAttribute and DeviceData now throws exception if trying
     to extract data from empty instance.
     
   - WIN 32 specific : The polling thread uses WIndows Performance Counter to
     measure command or read attribute execution time


Bug fixes :
-----------

   - When getting attribute history from polling buffer and attribute has a
     quality factor set to ATTR_INVALID.
     
   - In the Database::get_class_property method. Could generate some strange
     "core dump/seg fault" in DeviceClass initialization.
     
   - In the admin device "DevRestart" command. The device name passed as
     parameter was still case dependant.
     
   - If date not set by the user, attribute date automatically set when
     attribute quality factor is ATTR_INVALID.
     
   - In the asynchronous PUSH_CALLBACK model. The callback thread ate all
     CPU power.
     
   - When inserting vector into DbDatum object. Still a stream problem.
   
   - Fix order in which device server classes are destroyed (opposite order
     than the one used during device server startup phase)
     
   - In Database::get_info() method for WIN32. A call to CORBA in() method
     was missing
     
   - In DeviceProxy::adm_name() method. It now returns full admin device name
     with host/port in case of non database device.
     
   - In device exit sequence if an exception was thrown during the 
     Util::init method.

	- In the DeviceProxy::command_inout_asyn() call using fire and
	  forget mode
	- In the State command for devices with attributes with an alarm
	  level set and with one of these attribute throwing exception 
							
- The Win32 device server graphical window "Debug" menu has been updated to
  take logging into account

- Added Attribute::set_write_value() methods

- Clean-up the way a device server is killed. The "kill" command of the
  administration device will generate the Valgrind report file
  if the server is started using Valgrind. If you want to benefit from this
  change, add the Util::server_cleanup() call at the end of your device
  server main function. See Tango V4 doc chapter 8.4.6 for example.
	  
- Fix some gcc compiler warnings when used with its -Wall option

- Fix bug in the DeviceProxy copy constructor and assignement operator

  have alarm level defined but have its quality factor set to ALARM
		  
- Fix bug in DeviceProxy::poll_command(const char *...) and in 
  DeviceProxy::poll_attribute(const char *...)

  DeviceProxy::get_transparency_reconnection() methods to silently handle
  device reconnection
	  
- Added the ATTR_CHANGING attribute quality factor

- In the BY_CLASS and BY_PROCESS device server process serialization model,
  the class (or process) monitor is taken during device(s) creation
	      
- Fix bug when inserting/extracting vector in a DbDatum object. This bug 
  appaers only for vector with element of different size
  (for instance, a vector<double> with first element set to 1.2345 and the
  second element set to 2.3)
		      
- Change in polling strategy:
  - Add a random number of milli seconds (between 0 and 500) before the first
    polling of each object (command or attribute) to be polled
				      
  - Take command execution time into account in the "Data not updated since "
    polling status string
